# Pixel-Art-Maker
I created a Pixel Art Maker using Javascript, allowing users to create a guide (size of their choice) and redesign it via a range of colours.

Users are able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
